# Documentation Index

Guides for someone consuming or operating the API. `.claude/rules/` is written for someone changing
the code.

## Interactive docs

With `ENABLE_API_DOCS=true` (set in `.env.example` for local work):

- `http://localhost:3000/docs` — Scalar UI
- `http://localhost:3000/docs/openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3 spec

The spec is generated from the `createRoute(...)` definitions, so it is as accurate as the routes'
declared schemas and responses. Use the `Bearer` button with an access token from `POST /auth/login`.
