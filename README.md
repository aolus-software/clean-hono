# Clean Hono Starter Template

A clean, production-ready starter template for building modern web applications with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This template provides a well-structured monorepo setup with TypeScript, database integration, Docker support, and development best practices.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Framework & Runtime

- **⚡ Hono Framework**: Fast, lightweight, and modern web framework for Bun
- **🔷 TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict configuration
- **📦 Bun Runtime**: Lightning-fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

## 🚧 TODO / Missing Features

This section tracks unimplemented or planned features:

- **ClickHouse Integration**: ClickHouse migration scripts are commented out in the Makefile; implement and enable them.
- **Testing**: Add and document automated tests (unit, integration, e2e).
- **Documentation**: Keep this README and code comments in sync with actual code features.

If you contribute, please check this list and help complete these features!

make db-studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
make db-drop          # Drop all tables (dangerous!)
make db-seed          # Run database seeder

# Combined Workflows
make fresh            # Drop database, push schema, and seed
make reset            # Generate migrations, migrate, and seed

## 🗄️ Database Setup

This template uses Drizzle ORM for database operations:

1. **Configure your database** in `.env`:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
   ```

2. **Generate database migrations**:

   ```bash
   bun run db:generate
   ```

3. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate
   ```
