# Skills

Vendored Claude Code skills for this repository. `.claude/skills` is a relative symlink to this
directory (`ln -s ../.agents/skills .claude/skills`), so a skill added here is available immediately.
Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (frontmatter `name` + `description`, then instructions).

The bundle is tracked in git; `skills-lock.json` is gitignored, so drift from the sibling clean-arc
repositories is detected by diffing this directory. Do not edit these as part of unrelated work.
